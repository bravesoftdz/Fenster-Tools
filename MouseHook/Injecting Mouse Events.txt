Windows 7:

- all mouse wheel events are delivered to the focus window -> using mouse_event would deliver the message again to the focus window and NOT to the window under the mouse pointer because you can't specify a target window handle in mouse_event (or SendInput)
- thatswhy we use PostMessage to deliver the scroll message to the window under mouse pointer

Windows 10:
- using PostMessage to deliver scroll messages work fine in Desktop Applications but not in WinRT (WindowsStore Apps), cause it uses a completely different API.
- thus we must inject mouse events at a deeper layer, so we use mouse_event (better: SendInput) to simulate scrolling directly invoked by the mouse driver
- FensterTools detects LLMHF_INJECTED flag and doesn't reprocess this mouse event (prevents endless loop)
- delivering scroll messages to the window under mouse pointer by FensterTools is no longer needed, Windows 10 by defaul delivers mouse wheel events to the window under the mouse pointer
